# The first certificate 

At this point I am more than ecstatic about having acquired my certificate of completion in Software Engineering

## An official Junior Software Developer 

You would think it's just as exciting job hunting for a profession in the qualification you've been pursuing for longest time...
Let me cut to the chase and surprise you: it's not.

I had a misinformed interpretation of what the job hunting experience would be like if I had more passion about what I was doing. Logically, I would enjoy seeking employment as much as I enjoy the work and my career choices. No, I didn't. It only made it more so frustrating and nerve wracking. It made it excruciating. And the silence was a far more painful stab than rejection, because it was rejection disguised as **hope**.

### Hope

Hope soon to be shattered by realization rather than clarity. The pain of uncertainty and angst only added to the discomfort of waiting, and patience wore much thinner than paper.
